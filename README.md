# MUSA 611, Week 7

## Mid-term Exercise

* Create a feature collection that tells a story. It can be a personal story, or
  the story of a place, a project, a process, a people, whatever you want, as
  long as you ground that story in location.

### Task 1: Prepare Geographic Data

Think about what data you want to tell a story about. You can choose a dataset from any of the following sources:

* Use data you've been working with for another class
* Find data from an open data repository (see [sample open data sources](sample-open-data-sources.md))
* Create your own dataset (check out [geojson.io](https://geojson.io))

**Data Requirements**
* At least five data points
* At least one property that can be used to filter the data and color the data
* Points, lines, and polygons are all fine
* Data should be real stuff (don't create a dataset with fictional locations)

### Task 2: Think About Slide Data

Your story will have multiple slides, each with a title, some additional text, and geographic data. It might also need to contain information about how you will filter or style the data for that particular slide. This kind of structure is another type of data.

How will you represent this data that is about the slides? In slideModel.js, write a brief example that shows what the data for one slide might look like. Think about how it will be stored and read in Javascript (arrays, objects, etc.).
