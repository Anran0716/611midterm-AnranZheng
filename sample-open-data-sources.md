# Sample Open Data Sources

## OpenDataPhilly.org (or other cities' open data portals)

OpenDataPhilly has lots of Philadelphia-specific data, like:

- [Neighborhood Boundaries](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-neighborhoods)
- Historic [Streets](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/historic-streets), [Districts](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-registered-historic-districts), or [Properties](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-registered-historic-sites)
- [School Information](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/school-information-data)
- [PA Horticultural Society Land Care](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset/land-care)

Many other cities, counties, states, and countries have dedicated data portals as well. Here are a couple of lists of state-sponsored open data sites:

- [Data.gov - Open Government](https://data.gov/open-gov/)
- [Open Knowledge Foundation - DataPortals.org](https://dataportals.org/)
